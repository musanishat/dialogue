Dialogue, a website where artists can share and discuss their art:
A website which archives artists' work. A user can create and account which will
allow them to post their own art (as jpegs/pngs), and 
upvote/comment on/favorite posted work. The default homepage for both logged in and unlogged 
in visitors will be the top rated/recent posts, but users will also have a favorites
page where they will see posts they've favorited.
Users also have their own pages full of all their posted art

USER STORIES:
1) I am an aspiring artist. I want to post my art somewhere other artist's can
see it and share their thoughts. I can make a Dialogue account and post images 
of my art as well as a description of each piece. Now I also have a repository/
portfolio of all my work.

2) I am very interested in up-and-coming neo-realist digital artists. Since my interest 
is very niche, I can find artists on Dialogue that are making the kind I like and favorite
to their posts.

3) I am a Dialogue user and art enthusiast. I think user @Xxpicasso_sux69xX is doing
something very new and original and want to let them know. So I leave a comment on their
latest work, "ðŸ”¥".
